i think i will just watch takagi san. even though i wont understand everything yet at least this is a starting point.

i just found out there's a live action for takagi san on netflix JP... that's interesting i might watch that first...?

22:23 I started the Live action of Takagi San...... ngl I think I'm in a bit of trouble cuz I don't understand 70% of what theyre saying. Oh well I just gotta keep at it until I understand.
