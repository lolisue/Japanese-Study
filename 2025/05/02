Skimmed through https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA_RcUI8km1NMhiEebcbqdlcHv_2ngbO2 as I've already completed Genki I like in 2023/24 and then stopped ever since.

Seems like I already know most of it, except for some key points in lesson 11 and 12 (the last two vids in the playlist).

I plan to do his Genki II playlist since I haven't gotten past Genki II, only did like 4 lessons from the book by myself. Using this video playlist would be a great boost to my ability to learn (i am a visual learner after all).

I do plan on getting into immersion sooner rather than later because that is how u improve on language learning the fastest. Also prob just talk to actual ppl on discord in exchange servers.

For now ill just watch Genki II playlist.
