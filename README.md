# Japanese-Study
My commitment to Japanese mastery begins here.

I've put off my Japanese study for years now, due to my lack of motivation. I want to change that, so I made this repository as opposed to using a habit tracker. Nothing is more satisfying than looking at your almost all-green boxed GitHub contribution visual graph on your profile page. (I mean, who does that though, using GitHub as a general habit tracker...)
