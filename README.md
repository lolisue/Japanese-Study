# Japanese-Study
My commitment to Japanese mastery begins here.

I've put off my Japanese study for years now, due to my lack of motivation. I want to change that, so I made this repository as opposed to using a habit tracker. Nothing is more satisfying than looking at your almost all-green boxed GitHub contribution visual graph on your profile page. (I mean, who does that though, using GitHub as a general habit tracker...)

In this repo you'll find notes/insights I've written down for the days I've studied Japanese (but not always). It's a great way to show my Japanese studying journey to people like you who are reading this right now.

In the future I might even just write things in Japanese entirely because I would be so fluent by then XD.

Anyways, have a good day and take care of yourself.
